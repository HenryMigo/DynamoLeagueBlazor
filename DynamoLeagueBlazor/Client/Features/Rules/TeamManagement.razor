<MudExpansionPanel Text="Team Management">
    Management of a team is each owners responsibility. The league will have rosters in the Yahoo Fantasy app, this app will be used for all other functions that are not possible in yahoo.
    Co-owners are welcome as there is a lot of management in the Dynamo League. Team names are mandatory, no one wants to play Tom's Swell Team. Not having an original team name will result in a
    fine of $5/week starting in week 1.
