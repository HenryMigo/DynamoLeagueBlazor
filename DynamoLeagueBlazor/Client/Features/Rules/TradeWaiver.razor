<MudExpansionPanel Text="Trade/Waiver">
    Acquiring players through traders or waivers requires enough cap space to obtain a player. If an acquisition results in exceeding your cap, the owner(s) will pay a luxury tax equal to
    double the amount over the cap. Once a team is over cap, the only moves allowed will be to get back under the cap. A team cannot continue to purchase high end players. When trading a player,
    that players remaining contract will be transfered to the new owner(s). The commissioner will be responsible for approving trades and only trades with blatant collusion will be stopped. Each owner(s)
    will have a $200 FAAB to spend on waivers, and the FAAB amount spent will be the acquired players contract salary. All waiver pickups are a one year contract, with the owner having the options to
    franchise or make the player a Restricted Free Agent at the end of the season.
