 <MudExpansionPanel Text="Restricted Free Agents">
    Restricted free agents will be silent auctioned throughout the off-season. Teams can bid for a restricted free agent, and the owner(s) of that player will have the chance to match
    the bid. If a restricted free agent receives no bids, they will be returned to the waiver pool.
